                The good news is that you can free yourself from your mind. This
                is the only true liberation. You can take the first step right
                now.

              <p>
                <b>START LISTENING TO THE VOICE IN YOUR HEAD</b> as often as you
                can. Pay particular attention to any repetitive thought
                patterns, those old audiotapes that have been playing in your
                head perhaps for many years.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                This is what I mean by "watching the thinker," which is another
                way of saying: Listen to the voice in your head, be there as the
                witnessing presence.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                When you listen to that voice, listen to it impartially. That is
                to say, do not judge. Do not judge or condemn what you hear, for
                doing so would mean that the same voice come in again from the
                back door. You'll soon relize: There is the voice, and here I am
                listening to it, Watching it. This <i> I am </i> realization,
                this sense of your own presence, is not a thought. it arises
                from beyond the mind.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                So when you listen to a thought, you are aware not only of the
                thought but also of yourself as the witness of the thought. A
                new dimension of conciousness has come in.
