      <!-- Set and setting not only in psychedelic trips but also in regular everyday
      life. Considering the condtions of planets and stars. There is this
      possibility of fireing everything up. There might be some miss
      understandings in this regard. One might find this unpredictable and out
      of control. Although truth is supreme. There shouldnt be any bais or any
      stream of thought, and it becomes like a volcano. There is no possibility
      to grasp this by intellect. and at the same time it is very intellectual.
      Then there is this ego and the same cycle repeats. -->

      <!-- There are some methods to ease up this flow. and it becomes angelic. They
      are a set of meticulous techniques. For example, coding. Coding teaches us
      not to be perfect. And at the same time try for perfection. There are
      codes which are perfect on their own. This is where it is beautiful. Share
      it, although it is not perfect. But it is perfect for its own. Death will
      come. You can always come back and work on it untill it reaches its
      potential. -->
